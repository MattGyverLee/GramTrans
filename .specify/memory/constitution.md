Sync Impact Report
==================
Version change: 4.0.0 → 5.0.0
Bump rationale: MAJOR — Principle II redefined again. v4.0.0's mandatory
flavor-adapter contract (`flavors/base.py` + per-flavor adapters as the only
allowed import point for LCM operations) is REMOVED. v5.0.0 says: every
Phase 0/1/2 module file imports `flexlibs2` directly. The LibLCM-direct port
is now a **separate fork project** (a sibling repo built on the same spec/plan
artifacts), not a same-contract in-tree re-implementation. This redefinition
codifies the actual shape on disk (the FLExTrans-style entry file plus a `Lib/`
sibling directory of helpers) and the chosen flexlibs2-fork dependency model.

Additionally, Principle III (Preview-Before-Mutate) is preserved unchanged in
spirit but gains an explicit, one-time validation-spike clause acknowledging
that the Layer 1 + Layer 2 work in STATUS.md ran Move-mode writes against a
live throwaway target before the Preview engine existed. All further Move
work is gated on the Preview engine.

Principles defined:
  I.   FLEx Domain Fidelity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  II.  FlexTools-Compatible Output, flexlibs2-Direct                   (REDEFINED)
  III. Preview-Before-Mutate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)                          (clarified)
  IV.  Phased Merge Discipline                                         (clarified)
  V.   Referential Completeness

Modified principles:
  II. v4.0.0 "flexlibs2-Primary with LibLCM Backport (adapter pattern mandatory)"
      → v5.0.0 "flexlibs2-Direct (no adapter pattern in this repo)". Module
      code imports flexlibs2 directly. There is no `flavors/base.py`, no
      `flavors/flexlibs2_adapter.py`, no `flavors/liblcm_adapter.py` in this
      tree. The LibLCM-direct port lives in a separate sibling repository
      authored after all merge phases ship in flexlibs2, sharing only the spec
      artifacts (spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/) — not source files.

  III. Preview-Before-Mutate (NON-NEGOTIABLE) is unchanged in normative force.
      Added: a one-time, recorded validation spike (STATUS.md Layer 1 + Layer 2)
      is acknowledged as predating the Preview engine. All further Move-mode
      work — Layer 3 included — MUST go through `Lib/preview.py` (plan-builder)
      and `Lib/transfer.py` (plan-executor).

  IV. Phase 3 redefined from "in-tree LibLCM port" to "LibLCM fork project".
      Phase 3 is no longer part of this repo's tree.

Kept from v4.0.0:
  - The shipped artifact is a FlexTools-compatible module.
  - The FLExToolsMCP is a non-normative author-side assistant, not a runtime
    dependency.
  - flexlibs2 is the runtime flavor for Phase 0/1/2.
  - flexlibs1 is NOT used.
  - GOLD inviolability, GUID-first identity, dual-carrier residue.

Removed framing:
  - "flavor adapter pattern is mandatory from day one" (removed).
  - "`flavors/base.py` defines the contract; `flavors/flexlibs2_adapter.py` is
    implemented in full" (removed — no `flavors/` directory exists).
  - "All `core/` and `categories/` code calls the adapter contract — never raw
    flexlibs2 imports directly" (reversed — modules import flexlibs2 directly).

Added framing:
  - flexlibs2 is consumed as a **forked, patched dependency** (the
    MattGyverLee/flexlibs2 fork carrying the `WritingSystems` enumeration fix
    and the new `ApplySyncableProperties` method on `BaseOperations` + 8
    Grammar Operations subclasses). The fork relationship is documented in
    [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) and in the repo README; pyproject.toml leaves
    the requirement as `flexlibs2>=2.0` and users / developers install the
    fork manually.
  - File layout follows the **FLExTrans module convention**: a flat entry
    file (`src/gramtrans/gramtrans.py` with `docs = {...}` + `def MainFunction(
    project, report, modifyAllowed)`) plus a sibling `Lib/` subdirectory of
    helpers loaded via `site.addsitedir(r"Lib")`. No `flavors/`, no `ui/`,
    `core/`, `categories/` subpackages — instead flat helpers under `Lib/`.

Templates requiring updates:
  ✅ .specify/memory/constitution.md (this file)
  ⚠ .specify/templates/plan-template.md — Constitution Check should describe
      the post-Phase-2 LibLCM fork as a sibling deliverable, not an in-tree
      port.

Downstream artifact updates required (in this project):
  ⚠ specs/001-phase0-additive-transfer/plan.md — Summary, Technical Context,
      Constitution Check Row II, Project Structure (FLExTrans layout).
  ⚠ specs/001-phase0-additive-transfer/spec.md — FR-001 clarifies the entry
      shape; Assumptions API-surface paragraph.
  ⚠ specs/001-phase0-additive-transfer/data-model.md — drop the `Flavor` enum
      LIBLCM forward-compat field on PlannedAction (Phase 3 is a separate
      fork project; this tree only ever produces FLEXLIBS2 actions).
  ⚠ specs/001-phase0-additive-transfer/contracts/category-transfer.md — drop
      the flavor-adapter framing; categories call flexlibs2 directly.
  ⚠ specs/001-phase0-additive-transfer/tasks.md — drop T016 / T017 / T018
      (flavor adapter scaffolding + stub); collapse leaf-category tasks
      (T039–T048) into one inline `Lib/categories.py` task; keep dedicated
      files only for affixes / templates / MSAs; add the Layer 1+2 refactor
      spike task; add an FR-020 (target-locked) task.

Deferred items: none new. The LibLCM-direct port is now a separate fork
project, not a deferred in-tree task.

# GramTrans Constitution

GramTrans is a FlexTools module that transfers FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) grammar
data — phonology, morphology, lexicon scaffolding, and templates — from a "toy" project to
a production project. This constitution governs how the module is designed, built, and
evolved.

## Core Principles

### I. FLEx Domain Fidelity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All transfer operations MUST preserve the semantics defined by the FieldWorks Language and
Culture Model (LCM) and the user's mental model in FLEx. Specifically:

- GUIDs are the primary identity for LCM objects; preserve them on transfer whenever the
  target project does not already contain a colliding GUID.
- Reserved/GOLD categories and inflection features MUST be retained — never overwritten,
  renamed, or deleted as a side effect of import.
- Writing-system identity (vernacular/analysis mappings) MUST be validated and explicitly
  mapped before any string-bearing field is written.
- Cross-references (affix → slot, slot → template, allomorph → environment, APR → category,
  etc.) MUST resolve to real objects in the target after transfer, or the transfer for that
  item MUST fail loudly rather than silently drop the reference.

Rationale: A transfer that corrupts LCM invariants or breaks FLEx's UI assumptions is worse
than no transfer at all — users will lose trust and revert.

### II. FlexTools-Compatible Output, flexlibs2-Direct

The module's shipped artifact MUST be a **FlexTools-compatible module** that runs inside a
standard FlexTools host. At runtime it imports **flexlibs2 directly**. There is no
flavor-adapter contract in this repository — the v4.0.0 `flavors/base.py` requirement is
removed.

- **flexlibs2 (Python) is the direct runtime dependency.** Every Phase 0/1/2 file imports
  flexlibs2 modules at the top (`from flexlibs2.BaseOperations import ApplySyncableProperties`,
  `from flexlibs2.Grammar.POSOperations import POSOperations`, etc.). The Operations-class
  API is the canonical surface (`project.POS`, `project.MorphRule`,
  `project.InflectionFeature`, `project.MSA`, `project.Phonemes`, `project.PhonRules`,
  `project.WritingSystem`, `project.LexEntry`, `project.LexSense`, `project.Allomorph`,
  `project.Variant`, `project.CustomField`, etc.); `project.GetService(IFooFactory)` is the
  fallback when no Operations wrapper covers a specific LCM surface;
  `CastingOperations.cast_to_concrete(obj)` is used when polymorphic property access
  requires casting (per MCP polymorphic-casting validator).
- **flexlibs2 is consumed as a forked, patched dependency.** The runtime depends on the
  MattGyverLee/flexlibs2 fork at `D:/Github/_Projects/_LEX/flexlibs2`, which carries:
  (a) a fix to `GetSyncableProperties` so it enumerates writing systems via
  `project.WritingSystems.GetAll()` instead of the nonexistent
  `ws_factory.WritingSystems` attribute, and (b) a new `ApplySyncableProperties(item, props,
  ws_map=None)` method on `BaseOperations` plus the 8 Grammar Operations subclasses that
  expose it for MCP-indexer visibility. `pyproject.toml` declares `flexlibs2>=2.0`;
  developers install the fork manually and the fork relationship is documented in the
  repo README and [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).
- **LibLCM (.NET) is NOT consumed in this repository.** The LibLCM-direct implementation
  is a **separate fork project** — a sibling repo authored after all three merge phases
  ship in flexlibs2. It shares only the spec artifacts (spec.md, data-model.md,
  contracts/*) and re-implements the same module against raw LCM. No `flavors/`,
  `liblcm_adapter.py`, or "deferred port" stub lives in this tree.
- **flexlibs1 is NOT used.** v4.0.0 already retired flexlibs1; v5.0.0 carries that
  forward. Historical mentions in spec artifacts and `Transfer FLEx Grammar Module.md` are
  read as historical context, not normative direction.
- **The FlexTools host MUST NOT be assumed to have any optional dependencies beyond
  flexlibs2 (forked) and PyQt.** The module MUST degrade gracefully (skip + report) if
  flexlibs2 is unexpectedly unavailable.

**Note on the FLExToolsMCP.** The FLExToolsMCP is an *author-side* assistant used to
generate, scaffold, and discover patterns for the code in this repo. It is **not** a
runtime dependency, **not** part of the shipped module, and **not** normative for end
users. References to MCP tools belong in development workflow notes, not in module code.

Rationale: The flavor-adapter pattern was tried in v4.0.0 and produced overhead with no
payoff during a single-flavor build. The post-Phase-2 LibLCM port is a clean re-implementation
better authored in a sibling repo where the team can pick the natural raw-LCM idioms
instead of contorting to fit a Python-shaped adapter contract. Both repos share the spec,
not the code; that is the right boundary.

### III. Preview-Before-Mutate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every transfer MUST support two execution modes, and Preview MUST be the default:

- **Preview Mode** — compute the full set of intended additions, overwrites, and skips and
  present them to the user without writing anything to the target project.
- **Move Mode** — perform the writes only after the user has reviewed a preview from the
  current session's selection state.

Preview output MUST list, per item: source GUID, target match (by GUID then fingerprint),
proposed action (Add / Overwrite / Skip / Merge), and the dependency closure that will be
pulled along. Move Mode MUST be undoable through FLEx's standard undo stack wherever LCM
permits, and MUST tag newly created entries in Import Residue.

**One-time validation-spike clause** (recorded for honesty, not licence to repeat): the
Layer 1 + Layer 2 work documented in `STATUS.md` (Verb POS, Verb template, 4 slots copied
from Ejagham Mini to a throwaway `Ejagham Full GT-Test` target) ran Move-mode writes
before the Preview engine existed. This was a deliberate validation spike to confirm the
flexlibs2 surface end-to-end against a real LCM target. It is acknowledged as a one-time
exception. All further Move work — Layer 3 included — MUST route through `Lib/preview.py`
(plan-builder) and `Lib/transfer.py` (plan-executor), and the existing
`gramtrans.py.transfer_verb_vertical()` MUST be refactored into that pair before Layer 3
begins.

Rationale: Users will run this on real projects. Surprise writes are unacceptable, and
the validation-spike clause is recorded so future maintainers do not read STATUS.md as
permission to skip the Preview engine.

### IV. Phased Merge Discipline

Merge sophistication ships in phases, and phases MUST be released in order. A later phase
MUST NOT be partially implemented before the prior phase is complete and validated:

- **Phase 0 — Additive.** Add new things unconditionally; duplicates are allowed; new
  entries are tagged in Import Residue; default vernacular mapping is updated; no merge
  UI. This phase MUST work end-to-end before Phase 1 begins.
- **Phase 1 — Overwrite.** Match by GUID first, fingerprint second; overwrite matched
  items; leave non-conflicting items untouched; deduplicate custom fields; UI lets the
  user choose which grammar piece categories to transfer.
- **Phase 2 — Interactive Merge.** Per-conflict prompt with {accept-merge, take-left,
  take-right, skip, other}; vernacular mapping wizard (SFM-import style); undoable.
- **Phase 3 (post-merge) — LibLCM fork project.** After Phases 0/1/2 ship in this repo
  against flexlibs2, a **separate sibling repository** re-implements the same module
  against raw LibLCM, reusing this repo's `spec.md`, `data-model.md`, and `contracts/`
  artifacts as the contract. No user-visible behavior changes; only the runtime flavor
  swaps. Phase 3 is NOT a task in this repo's tasks.md.

Rationale: Each phase is independently useful and shippable. Phasing prevents Phase 2's
complexity from blocking Phase 0's value, and the LibLCM port is decoupled from feature
work entirely by living in a sibling repo.

### V. Referential Completeness

When the user selects a grammar piece to transfer, the module MUST compute and transfer
its full dependency closure by default, including (non-exhaustive):

- Affixes pull their allomorphs, APRs, referenced inflection features, inflection classes,
  stem names, and exception features.
- Templates pull their slots and the affixes filling those slots.
- Inflection features and classes pull the categories they attach to.

The dependency closure MUST be displayed in Preview Mode and MUST be deselectable on a
per-item basis to allow a "bare-bones" transfer. Items whose dependencies cannot be
satisfied MUST be reported, not silently transferred in a broken state.

Rationale: Transferring an affix without its features produces a broken affix. Closure-by-
default is the only safe semantics; opt-out lets advanced users override.

## Technology & Architecture Constraints

- **Language & runtime:** Python 3, hosted by a standard FlexTools installation.
- **Module shape:** a FlexTools-compatible module — the entry file (`src/gramtrans/gramtrans.py`)
  exposes a `docs = {...}` metadata dict and a `MainFunction(project, report, modifyAllowed)`
  callable, per the FLExTrans-style convention (e.g.,
  `FLExTrans/FlexTools_2.3.2/FlexTools/Modules/Chinese/Update_Pinyin_Fields.py`). Helper
  modules live under `src/gramtrans/Lib/` and are loaded via `site.addsitedir(r"Lib")`.
- **Runtime API flavor:**
  - **flexlibs2** — the Pythonic Operations-class API, consumed as a **forked dependency**
    from MattGyverLee/flexlibs2 (carrying the `WritingSystems` enumeration fix and the new
    `ApplySyncableProperties` method). Imported directly by module files. No adapter
    indirection.
  - **LibLCM** — NOT consumed in this repo. The LibLCM-direct port is a separate
    post-Phase-2 sibling repository that re-implements the same spec.
  - **flexlibs1** — NOT used.
- **UI:** PyQt, hosted inside the FlexTools window. The main window exposes
  (a) grammar-piece category selection, (b) auto-selection toggle, (c) Preview vs Move
  mode, (d) overwrite policy, (e) writing-system mapping step, (f) post-run statistics
  panel.
- **No optional runtime dependencies:** the module MUST run with only what a stock
  FlexTools install plus the patched flexlibs2 and PyQt provide. Anything else is a hard
  "no" without a constitutional amendment.

### Author-Side Tooling (Non-Normative)

The **FLExToolsMCP** is a multi-API author-side assistant used to generate this code;
it is *not* a runtime dependency, *not* part of the shipped module, and *not* normative
for end users. Author-side use is encouraged but unconstrained — it is allowed to draft,
scaffold, and check code on the author's behalf. Any output it generates is still
subject to every other principle in this constitution.

- **Source projects:** the module operates source → target between two FLEx projects open
  to FlexTools; it MUST NOT depend on FLEx itself being open during the transfer.
- **Identity strategy:** GUID-first matching, fingerprint fallback (fingerprint definition
  per object class MUST be documented in the design doc).
- **Residue tagging:** every Add/Overwrite MUST be reflected in the per-object residue
  carrier so users can audit what changed. For LCM classes that expose `LiftResidue` /
  `ImportResidue`, that field is the carrier. For classes that do not (most grammar
  pieces — `IPartOfSpeech`, `IMoInflAffixTemplate`, `IMoInflAffixSlot`, `IFsClosedFeature`,
  etc.), the tag is appended to the inherited `Description` field with the marker
  `[GT-Tag]: GT|<run_id>|<source>|<iso_ts>` on its own line. The append is
  non-destructive (existing prose preserved).

## Development Workflow & Quality Gates

- **Specification flow:** features go through `/speckit-specify` → optional
  `/speckit-clarify` → `/speckit-plan` → `/speckit-tasks` → optional `/speckit-analyze` →
  `/speckit-implement`. Phase boundaries (Phase 0/1/2) MUST each have their own spec. The
  Phase 3 LibLCM-fork project re-uses Phase 0/1/2 specs verbatim in its sibling repo.
- **Constitution Check:** every plan MUST include an explicit Constitution Check section
  citing Principles I–V. Any violation MUST be justified or the plan rejected.
- **Domain review:** non-trivial LCM operations SHOULD be reviewed against upstream
  flexlibs2 conventions before merge.
- **Verification:** every shipped phase MUST include a verification run on a known toy
  project → target project pair, with pre/post Import Residue artifacts attached.
- **No silent skips:** any item the module decides not to transfer (missing dependency,
  unresolved writing system, unsupported LCM type) MUST appear in the post-run statistics
  panel.
- **Preview engine first:** before Layer 3 (LexEntry / Sense / MSA / Allomorph /
  PhEnvironment) implementation begins, the existing inline Move logic in
  `gramtrans.py.transfer_verb_vertical()` MUST be refactored into a plan-builder
  (`Lib/preview.py`) and a plan-executor (`Lib/transfer.py`) per Principle III. This is
  the closing of the one-time validation-spike clause.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes ad-hoc development practices for the GramTrans module.

- **Amendments** require: (a) a written rationale, (b) a version bump per the policy
  below, (c) propagation through `.specify/templates/*` so plans, specs, and task lists
  remain consistent, and (d) an updated Sync Impact Report at the top of this file.
- **Versioning policy** (semantic):
  - MAJOR — a principle is removed, redefined, or made non-binding; or a phase is
    reordered.
  - MINOR — a principle or normative section is added or materially expanded.
  - PATCH — clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
- **Compliance reviews** occur at each phase release boundary and whenever a `/speckit-plan`
  Constitution Check flags a violation.
- **Source of truth:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. The notes in
  `Transfer FLEx Grammar Module.md` are advisory and MUST be reconciled with this
  constitution when they conflict.
